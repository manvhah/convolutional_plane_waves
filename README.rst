"A convolutional plane wave model for sound field reconstruction"
=================================================================

This repository provides a Python_ implementation of plane wave models for sound field reconstruction.
In particular, global, local and convolutional plane wave models are provided.
Please refer to the `paper (arXiv) https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11324` or get in touch for more details.
Updates are expected in the publishing process.

Structure
----------------

Repo is structured as follows::

   .
   ├── Makefile                       # [Makefile to install dependencies, download data, and run the scripts]
   ├── data                           # [data sets, get it via 'make data' or link below]
   ├── src                            # [helper functions and tools]
   ├── figures                        # [folder is generated by scripts]
   ├── README.rst
   ...

To generate the figures
-----------------------

Step 1) clone repository and start a fresh python environment
Step 2) install python packages dependencies::

    make install

Step 3) Download measurement data set (uses wget to download the `published dataset https://data.dtu.dk/articles/dataset/Acoustic_frequency_responses_in_a_conventional_classroom/13315286`; Results for Figure 7 are included in the repo as it takes a long time to generate).::

    make data

Step 4) run the different scripts, generate the graphs and collect the pdfs in ./figures ::

    make
